# Devils-Advocate
A kodi based Android Retro Frontend.

Version 1.01 

# Why ? 

- Ever thought " I want a better Android  frontend" . Well so did we and got cracking. 

# How ? 

- A combination of Kodi, Advanced Emu Launcher, Internet Archive Launcher, Kodi Retro Player , a lot of sweat, tears, testing cursing and time .

# What makes this different ? 

- We hear what you want and make changes . 

- Plays movies and TV cause its Kodi based .

- Gets and plays games from Internet Archive Game Launcher 

- Built in emus for most systems . don't have to use a second third etc app for most systems.

- Crazy customizing.  since kodi based you can change the skin then icons, backgrounds, launch commands tons of stuff. 

- Made by community for community , 

- ALWAYS FREE.

- Never on Play Store 


# TO DO / THE FUTURE 

- More Pre setup themes

- Get install size smaller (up to community)

- Add retroarch/stand alone app launching. Kodi doesn't support atm on Android 11.

- More menu items setup . Hacks, IAGL, stuff like that .

- Add more APKs . (Passively adding)

- More builds for more devices. First Retroid Pocket 2+.

- Whatever we can do that community suggests .

- Implemnt Advanced Kodi Launcher. Similar to Advanced Emu Launcher but smoother UI.

- Fork Kodi to be a standalone App. This makes it where Devils Advocate is a different app than Kodi . 

- More Videos .
